"" NOTE: Here begins the configuration script for the JCommenter. Later on this
" same file you can find the real script.

" the new options!).

" Configuration file for jcommenter
"
" Copy the necessary contents from this file to your .vimrc, or modify this
" file and add a source command to vimrc to read this file.
"
" The initial settings correspond with Sun's coding conventions.

" A way to automate the creation of the comments. Works only if the
" class/method declaration is on one row. Comments are generated when the
" beginning '{' is entered, if the proper function/class declaration is found.
" Should work independet of the location of the '{'. Recognizing whether the 
" '{' starts a class/method or something else might fail, and comments might
" be generated for example for an 'if' clause. Has not happened yet, though.
" Uncomment to activate:
"imap <silent> { {<esc>:call search('\w', 'b')<cr>:call ConditionalWriter()<cr>0:call search('{')<cr>a

" a nice trick:
" If you type '}-' and a space/enter/esc, jcommenter will be
" automatically called on the function/class declaration whose end the '}' is:
